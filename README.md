AutoWaterMLG - Fabric mod (Minecraft 1.21.8)
===========================================

This project contains a minimal Fabric mod that performs automatic water-bucket MLG
when the player falls while holding a water bucket.

Notes:
- Target Minecraft: 1.21.8
- Uses Fabric Loom; adjust versions if needed.
- CI workflow installs Gradle on runner (so gradlew is not required). If you prefer wrapper,
  generate it locally using './gradlew wrapper' and commit the wrapper files.
